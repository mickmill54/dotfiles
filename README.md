# dotfiles
chenxiaolong's precious!

Planing to build a full install procedure for the simple minded...that would be me.
The one thing I wanted to remember is this git pull command to get all the submodules before you run the script.

Steps:
git clone {this repo}
cd dotfiles
git submodule update --recursive --init
./install


Todo:
Change shell to zsh
update .zshrc
update .alias
...
